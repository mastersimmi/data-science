This repository serves as a showcase of my skills and capabilities as an intern at CodeClause. Within its contents, you'll find a collection of tasks that I have successfully completed during my time at the Codeclause. Each task serves as a testament to my hard work and dedication to my role as an intern. This repository is not only a source of pride for myself, but also serves as a valuable reference for my work at CodeClause and for my future professional endeavors.
